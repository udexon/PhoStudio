PhoStudio --- A Poor Man's Video / Audio Editing Tool

YouTube video demo:
- https://youtu.be/GDjssMFEVjM

Blender is very powerful video and audio editing tool, but perhaps too complex for beginners to pick up quickly.

Our long term plan: 

- PhoStudio will use [Phoscript](https://github.com/udexon/Multiweb/blob/master/Phoscript_Tutorials.md) to ___simplify Blender Python programming___, by using commands in Reverse Polish Notations, such as: 
```

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how we use PhoStudio / Phoscript to interface to two very powerful but complex tools to produce a simple video clip:

1. WebRTC Capture functions (canvas recording and download video)
2. ffmpeg cropping video to exact resolutions (1920x1080)
