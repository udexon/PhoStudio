# PhoStudio
PhoStudio --- A Poor Men's Blender

(Link to YouTube video ....)

Blender is very powerful video and audio editing tool, but perhaps too complex for beginners to pick up quickly.

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how we use PhoStudio / Phoscript to interface to two very powerful but complex tools to produce a simple video clip:

1. WebRTC Capture functions (canvas recording and download video)
2. ffmpeg cropping video to exact resolutions (1920x1080)
